In my implementation of the binary search tree I used the "AVL" and "Treap" tree methods.

For the "Put" method I tested adding integers to each tree:
	By comparing the graphs I generated I found that the AVL tree was more efficient time-wise.
For the "Remove" method I tested by removing integers from each tree:
	From my comparison I found the Treap tree was slightly more efficiend than the AVL tree,
	they both had similar trends but the dips in time needed showed the Treap tree would be the better choice for deleting in this instance.
